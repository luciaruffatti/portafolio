          This project consisted in creating a publication about Chucho Reyes that showcased his most famous artworks
          throughout
          his life. His biography was written by Arturo López Rodrigo. <br>
          <br>
          Jesús Reyes Ferreira, (1880-1977) born José de Jesús Benjamín Buenaventura de los Reyes y Ferreira and also
          known as
          Chucho Reyes, was a self-taught artist and antiques/art collector and vendor. As a self-taught painter, his
          works are
          relatively simple and often are dismissed as folk painting but they were and his aesthetics were praised by
          famous
          artists and architects at the time.
